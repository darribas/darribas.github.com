### Research Methods for Dissertations (GGM-201a)

I am coordinating the course "Research Methods for Dissertations", which aims to introduce Second Year students to the main methodological approaches and philosophical debates in contemporary Geography. This is a team-taught module in which various members of staff contribute lectures on their main expertise.

Information and materials for the course are available on the Canvas system
